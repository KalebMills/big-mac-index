### Notes for Reviewer

1. The task did not explain how the data in the csv should be handled. Almost every country in the CSV has multiple entries, and is unclear whether the data should be filtered or cleaned in any way.
2. Probably doesn't matter, but the dataset doesn't include the notation for the country's currency notation
